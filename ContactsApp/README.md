<h2> Contacts App </h2> 

<h3> Description </h3>
Create a Contacts app modeled after the Cover Viewer app (Sections 13.5 –13.6). Store the contact information in an ObservableList of Contact objects. A Contact should contain first name, last name, email and phone number properties (you can provide others). When the user selects a contact from the contacts list, its information should display in a Grid of TextFields. As the information is modified (a Contact’s data is updated, a new Contact is added or an existing Contact is deleted), the contacts ListView should display the updates. The ListView should display the Contact’s last names.
